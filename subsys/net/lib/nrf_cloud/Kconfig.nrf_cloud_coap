	  The initial release of CoAP for nRF Cloud did not provide a way to
	  configure the response; it defaulted to always returning the location
	  and method used to acquire the location. The cloud will soon support
	  configuration values do_reply, fallback, and hi_conf. When the cloud
	  support is ready, NRF_CLOUD_COAP_GF_CONF can be set true.

	  The nRF Cloud Wi-Fi location service does not require the human-
	  readable SSIDs in order to determine the device location. It does
	  require the access point MAC addresses. By not including SSIDs
	  the amount of data sent to the cloud is greatly reduced.

	  Please note that this option stores your device's private key in unprotected memory.
	  It is not secure, and for testing purposes only.
